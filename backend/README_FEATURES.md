## Feature mapping & next steps
- Authentication & Roles: implemented via JWT in routes/auth.js and middleware/auth.js
- Project Management: models/Project.js and routes/projects.js
- Collaboration: comments/likes/follow implemented
- Search & Recommendations: basic text search implemented; recommendation engine placeholder to be implemented (use vector DB or embedding-based cosine search)
- Resume & Portfolio: add endpoint to auto-generate portfolio from projects (suggested implementation in next steps)
- Gamification: user.points updated on project upload; badges array exists
- API-first: REST endpoints provided; easy to add GraphQL
- Cloud & Scalability: Docker + compose + example k8s manifest included
- Integrations: utils/github.js to fetch repo stats; LinkedIn sync requires OAuth and LinkedIn API keys (not included)

### Questions to help finalize the implementation
1. Do you want file uploads (project assets) stored in cloud object storage (S3) or in GitHub/GDrive links only?
2. Will you use a managed DB (Mongo Atlas) or self-hosted Mongo?
3. Do you want GraphQL instead of REST?
4. Any specific AI provider for recommendations (OpenAI, Cohere, HuggingFace)?
5. Do you want CI/CD configured to push Docker images to a registry (Docker Hub/GCR/ECR)?
